The term paper is about four pages. It may be a short review article or a short article about  
a problem you worked on. The goal is to tell a story, such as an experimental phenomenon, a  
theoretical frame work, etc.

Some possible term paper topics:

1. Magnetic orders and their spin waves
2. Boltzmann transport equation for bands with Berry curvature
3. Chern insulators (IQH states) and edge states
4. Graphene and Dirac fermions (and how to gap them)
5. Bilayer Graphene and its band structure
6. Weyl semi metals
7. Fractional quantum Hall states
8. Conformal field theories
9. Haldane phase (or AKLT state) of spin-1 chain
10. Topological superconductors and Majorana zero modes.
11. Quantum critical point and critical exponents.
12. Or any other topic in condensed matter physics.
