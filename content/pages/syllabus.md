## Course Meeting Times

Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 1.5 hours / session

## Prerequisites

[*18.06 Linear Algebra*](/courses/18-06sc-linear-algebra-fall-2011), [*18.700 Linear Algebra*](/courses/18-700-linear-algebra-fall-2013), or [*18.701 Algebra I*](/courses/18-701-algebra-i-fall-2010); and [*18.100A Introduction to Analysis*](/courses/18-100a-introduction-to-analysis-fall-2012), [*18.100B Analysis I*](/courses/18-100b-analysis-i-fall-2010), *18.100P Real Analysis*, or *18.100Q Real Analysis*; or permission of the instructor.

## Description

We will try to cover the following topics:

1) Semi classical approach

2) Emerging dynamics of quasiparticle (beyond Newton Law).

3) Geometric phase, Chern number, and fiber bundle.

4) Quantum Hall insulator – a topological phase of matter.

5) Interaction bosonic superfluid.

6) Quantum 1D Ising model and symmetry breaking.

7) Critical point in 1D Ising model and its dual free fermion model.

8) Topological superconductors

9) Half-qubits – Majorana zero modes

10) K-theory for symmetry protected topological phases of free fermions.

11) **Z2** topological order for 2D interacting bosons.

12) Emergent fermions and string operators.

13) Topological order and long range entanglement.

14) Higher category theory for topological excitations.

## Textbook and Notes

There is no assigned textbook for this course. Instead, detailed lecture notes are provided in the form of slide presentations used in class.

## Requirements

There will be weekly homework, due on Thursday at lecture. There will also be a term paper.
